Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself? 

This project was to code an environment where an intelligent agent, a pirate, can learn how to navigate through a maze successfully to find the treasure. 
If the pirate made a move that was beneficial to the end goal, then it was rewarded with points. However, if the pirate made an improper or unhelpful move, 
then negative points were given. With this system, the algorithm was able to learn through a trial-and-error process of learning what works and what does not.
For this project, I had to create the code for the deep q-training algorithm. The deep q-learning algorithm helped the agent receive the best reward. This means 
that the algorithm used deep neural networks to help determine the q-function for each possible state and action of the agent. Through doing this, it helped 
the agent learn what was the best path that maximized their reward. 


Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science: 
What do computer scientists do and why does it matter? 
How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist? 
What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization? 

 Computer scientists work in many different fields.  Using AI and algorithms can help in many different scenarios where a computer is needed to learn how
 to complete a task, such as finding the most optimal decision making process. This can help in many different situations, such as finding the best course of actions 
 for a game, diagnosing a medical condition, or even finding the best path for a driverless car. When approaching a problem, it is important to think of all possible 
 concerns as well as solutions. Thinking about all who will be affected can also help ensure that the program is designed to benefit all, not just certain 
 demographics. Ethical responsibilities are also important to consider. Making unbiased, beneficial, fair, and accurate artificial intelligence is of the utmost 
 importance. Ensuring all steps are taken so that an algorithm is designed right should be at the forefront of the computer scientistâ€™s mission.
